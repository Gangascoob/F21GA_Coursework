## Idea and Theme

The idea behind this coursework was a TV show centered around motorsport - specifically Formula 1 style.
Since there are many different physical areas of varying sizes and complexity in motorsports, I decided to focus the render and animation around some of the most iconic parts - the garages and, most importantly, the cars.

To keep everything within the size limits and achievable, I chose to build my environment around a garage containing a pair of cars as well as other various equipment - such as laptops, screens, stools. To avoid having to model the entire pitlane as well, closed garage doors were added so that the scene could be fully contained.
